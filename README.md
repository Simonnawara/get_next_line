# Get Next Line
The get_next_line project is part of the 42 curriculum, focusing on efficient file input handling in C.
<br/>
The objective is to implement a function that reads and returns one line at a time from a file descriptor, making it ideal for processing data streams or large files without excessive memory usage.

## Skils acquired during this project
- Dynamic memory management.
- Static variables
- System-level programming.

## Static Buffer: Our Faithful Memory Keeper
In our get_next_line function, we use a static variable like this

```C
char *get_next_line(int fd)
{
    static char *buffer;
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
This ```buffer``` isn't just any ordinary variable. Oh no, it's got superpowers! Let's break down why it's so special:

1. **Persistent Memory**: Unlike regular variables that forget everything when the function ends, our static buffer remembers its contents between function calls. It's like having a notepad that doesn't get erased when you close the book!

2. **Picking Up Where We Left Off**: Thanks to this memory, we can continue reading from exactly where we stopped last time. No need to start from the beginning of the file each time get_next_line is called.

3. **Handling Partial Reads**: Sometimes, we might read more than one line into our buffer. The static variable allows us to keep that extra data for the next function call, ensuring we don't lose any information.


### ðŸŒŸ A Quick Note
I hope this repository proves useful to you, whether you're working on the get_next_line project yourself, exploring my profile, or just curious about the 42 curriculum.
<br />Feel free to dive in, learn, and adapt the code as you see fit.
<br />Best of luck on your coding journey! ðŸš€
